## Total: 22 test files across 6 categories

## How to Test:
1. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
2. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser
3. Enter the path to this test folder in the input field
4. Click "Organize Files" to see the sorting in action
5. Check the settings to customize categories as needed

## Expected Result:
The system should create 6 subfolders (images, documents, media, executables, code, archives) and move each file to its appropriate category folder based on the file extension.

Note: All files in this folder are safe placeholder files created for testing purposes. No actual executables or harmful content is included.
